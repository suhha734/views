        For more information about specific situations and health conditions and getting the COVID vaccine, see

      <h2>What will happen at your appointment</h2>

      <h3>
      When you get there
      </h3>

      <p>
        A healthcare worker will talk you through what is going to happen.
  <p>  You will be asked:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          for your name, date of birth and physical address so we can verify this in the COVID Immunisation Register (you don't need to show photo ID)
        </li>
        <li>
        to give your verbal consent to receive the vaccine â€” this is standard practice for any vaccination.
        </li>
        <li>
          if you are aged 12 to 15, you can say yes or no to getting the vaccine yourself or your parent or caregiver can provide consent if you prefer
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
    Getting the vaccination
      </h3>
<p>
  A fully trained vaccinator will give you the vaccine in your upper arm.
  </p>
  <h3>
After receiving your vaccination
  </h3>
<p>
  You will need to stay for at least 15 minutes after your vaccination so we can make sure you are okay.
  <p> We will record information about your COVID-19 immunisations in our COVID Immunisation Register (CIR), including the batch number. You will be given a card that shows the date you have been vaccinated.
    </p>
